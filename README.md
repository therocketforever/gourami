## Basic cloneable application template with Sinatra, Grape, Sprockets & Cucumber

### What?

#### Sinatra

#### Grape

#### Sprockets

#### Cucumber

#### Other Cool Stuff

##### Bundler

### Why?

Because I like to make things & it seems a little silly to set this all up every time I want to try something.

### How?

Pretty simple really. Just clone this repo & start hacking. The goal is maybe to use some hooks to clear out the origin after a sucessfull intial clone.
